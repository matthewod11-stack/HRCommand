// HR Command Center - Context Builder Module
// Builds contextual system prompts for Claude with company and employee data

// Key responsibilities:
// 1. Extract employee mentions from user queries
// 2. Retrieve relevant employees with performance/eNPS data
// 3. Build system prompts with the "Alex" HR persona

- Build on previous conversations when you remember relevant context
- Use the ORGANIZATION DATA above to answer aggregate questions accurately

- This is guidance, not legal advice—the user acknowledged this during setup
- For anything involving potential litigation, recommend legal counsel
- You don't have access to confidential investigation details
- Compensation data is not available (V1)
