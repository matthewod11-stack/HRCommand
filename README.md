# HR Command Center

> Your company's HR brain—private, always in context, always ready to help.

A desktop AI assistant for HR professionals that keeps your employee data local while providing intelligent, context-aware guidance.

---

## What It Does

- **Knows Your Company** — Import employee data once, get answers that understand your specific context
- **Remembers Conversations** — References past discussions naturally ("I remember we discussed Sarah's performance in March...")
- **Protects Sensitive Data** — Auto-redacts SSNs and financial data before anything leaves your machine
- **Works Offline** — Browse employees and past conversations even without internet

## Who It's For

| Persona | Pain Point |
|---------|------------|
| Founder without HR | Wants to do right by people, no time to learn HR |
| Accidental HR person | Got the job by default, figuring it out as they go |
| Solo HR hero | 1 person, 200 employees, needs leverage not headcount |
