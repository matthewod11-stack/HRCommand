## Session 2025-12-29 (V2.2.2 Bug Fix — Department Substring Matching)

**Phase:** V2.2 — Data Intelligence Pipeline
**Focus:** Fix department substring matching false positive

### Summary
Fixed bug where department detection incorrectly matched "IT" inside words like "with". Query "Show me people with teamwork feedback" was falsely detecting `dept=IT` because `.contains("it")` matched the substring.

### Files Modified
```
src-tauri/src/context.rs       (+60 LOC)
  - matches_word_boundary() helper function (lines 898-931)
  - Updated department detection to use word boundaries
  - test_extract_mentions_department_word_boundary test
  - test_matches_word_boundary test
```

### Bug Fixed

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|------------|-----|
| "wITh" matches "IT" department | Simple `.contains()` substring matching | Word boundary checking (non-alphanumeric chars or string edges) |

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript type-check passes
- [x] Production build succeeds (805KB)
- [x] 222 Rust tests pass (1 pre-existing file_parser failure)
- [x] "Show me people with teamwork feedback" no longer detects IT dept
- [x] "How is IT doing?" still correctly detects IT dept

### Next Session Should
1. Continue with V2.2.5a (Critical Accessibility Fixes)
2. Or V2.3.1 (Org Chart View)
3. Or Phase 5.1 (Distribution)

## Session 2025-12-29 (V2.2.2 Debugging — Theme Retrieval Fixes)

**Phase:** V2.2 — Data Intelligence Pipeline
**Focus:** Debug and fix theme-based retrieval that wasn't working in production

### Summary
Diagnosed and fixed multiple issues preventing theme-based queries from working:
1. **Empty extraction tables** — `review_highlights` and `employee_summaries` were empty because test data was imported before V2.2.1g auto-trigger existed. Created manual extraction script and ran it on 237 reviews.
2. **Name detection false positive** — "Employees" was being detected as a person's name, causing queries to be classified as `Individual` instead of `Comparison`. Added common HR nouns to skip_words list.
3. **Wrong SQL column search** — `ThemeTarget::Strengths` was searching `rh.strengths` column for theme names, but that column contains textual descriptions, not theme tags. Fixed to always search `themes` column.

### Files Created
```
scripts/run-extraction.ts      (~200 LOC) - Manual extraction script for backfilling data
```

### Files Modified
```
src-tauri/src/context.rs       (+15/-20 LOC) -
                                - Added HR nouns to name detection skip_words
                                - Fixed find_employees_by_theme SQL to always search themes column
                                - Added 3 diagnostic tests (can be removed later)
package.json                   - Added better-sqlite3 dev dependency
```

### Bugs Fixed

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|------------|-----|
| Theme queries return no employees | `review_highlights` table empty | Ran manual extraction on 237 reviews |
| "Employees strong in X" → Individual | "Employees" detected as name | Added to skip_words list |
| `ThemeTarget::Strengths` returns 0 | SQL searched wrong column | Always search `themes` column |

### Data Extraction Results
- 235 review highlights extracted (2 API errors skipped)
- 87 employee summaries generated
- Top themes: execution (37), communication+execution (28), collaboration+execution (23)

### Known Issues Discovered
- "Show me people with teamwork feedback" incorrectly detects `dept=Some("IT")` — substring match bug for next session

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript type-check passes
- [x] Production build succeeds
- [x] 220 Rust tests pass (1 pre-existing file_parser failure)
- [x] "Employees strong in collaboration" returns employees ✓
- [ ] "Show me people with teamwork feedback" — has spurious IT department filter (bug for next session)

### Next Session Should
1. Fix department substring matching bug ("IT" in "wITh")
2. Continue with V2.2.5 (UI/UX Refinements) or V2.3.1 (Org Chart)
3. Consider adding "Run Extraction" button to Settings for future data backfills

## Session 2025-12-28 (V2.2.2b — Theme-Based Retrieval)

**Phase:** V2.2 — Data Intelligence Pipeline
**Focus:** Implement theme-based employee retrieval with department filtering and strength/opportunity targeting

### Summary
Implemented V2.2.2b theme-based retrieval. Queries like "who has leadership feedback?" or "communication issues in Engineering" now retrieve employees by mining extracted themes from performance reviews, with optional department filtering and smart inference of whether to search strengths vs. opportunities.

### Files Modified
```
src-tauri/src/context.rs    (+210 LOC) - ThemeTarget enum, QueryMentions extensions,
                                         theme detection in extract_mentions(),
                                         find_employees_by_theme() function,
                                         classify_query() update,
                                         build_chat_context() integration,
                                         8 new unit tests
```

### Key Implementation Details

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| ThemeTarget enum | `Any`, `Strengths`, `Opportunities` - determines which JSON field to search |
| Theme map | 10 themes + 22 semantic variants (e.g., "people skills" → communication) |
| Department filter | Optional - "leadership in Engineering" filters by theme AND department |
| Context inference | "needs help with X" → Opportunities, "strong in X" → Strengths |
| SQL query | Dynamic LIKE patterns on JSON arrays, grouped by employee, ordered by match count |

### Example Queries That Now Work

| Query | Themes | Target | Dept |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| "Who has leadership feedback?" | leadership | Any | — |
| "Communication issues in Engineering" | communication | Any | Engineering |
| "Who needs help with mentoring?" | mentoring | Opportunities | — |
| "Employees strong in collaboration" | collaboration | Strengths | — |

### Tests Added
- 8 new tests: direct theme, opportunity target, strengths target, dept filter, semantic variant, multiple themes, classify, default

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript type-check passes
- [x] Production build succeeds (805KB)
- [x] 217 Rust tests pass (8 new, 1 pre-existing file_parser failure)
- [x] V2.2.2 complete (all 4 subtasks)

### Next Session Should
1. V2.2.5a (Critical Accessibility Fixes) for UI polish
2. Or V2.3.1 (Org Chart) for visualization
3. Or Phase 5.1 (Distribution) for launch prep

## Session 2025-12-28 (V2.2.2a — Dynamic Excerpting Implementation)

**Phase:** V2.2 — Data Intelligence Pipeline
**Focus:** Implement dynamic excerpting to respect token budgets

### Summary
Implemented V2.2.2a dynamic excerpting for career summaries and review highlights. The system now uses Unicode sentence boundaries to intelligently truncate long content based on available token budget per employee.

### Files Modified
```
src-tauri/Cargo.toml              (+3 lines) - Added unicode-segmentation = "1.10"
src-tauri/src/context.rs         (+120 LOC) - Excerpting helpers + format function updates
                                              - excerpt_to_sentences() using Unicode segmentation
                                              - calculate_excerpt_limits() for budget → limits
                                              - calculate_per_employee_budget() for distribution
                                              - format_employee_context_with_budget() wrapper
                                              - format_single_employee_with_budget() with excerpting
                                              - 14 new unit tests
```

### Key Implementation Details

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Sentence splitting | `unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation::unicode_sentences()` |
| Budget thresholds | Full (≥800 tokens): 5 sentences, 3 cycles; Reduced (≥400): 2 sentences, 2 cycles; Tight (<400): 1 sentence, 1 cycle |
| Per-employee budget | `total_budget / employee_count` with 200 token floor |
| Ellipsis handling | Adds ".." after period-ending sentences, "..." otherwise |

### Tests Added
- 7 tests for `excerpt_to_sentences()`: empty, zero max, single, exact match, truncation, unicode, whitespace
- 3 tests for `calculate_excerpt_limits()`: full, reduced, tight budgets
- 4 tests for `calculate_per_employee_budget()`: single, multiple, minimum floor, zero employees

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript type-check passes
- [x] Production build succeeds (805KB)
- [x] 209 Rust tests pass (14 new, 1 pre-existing file_parser failure)

## Session 2025-12-28 (V2.2.2a Planning — Dynamic Excerpting)

**Phase:** V2.2 — Data Intelligence Pipeline
**Focus:** Plan implementation for dynamic excerpting to respect token budgets

### Summary
Explored codebase to understand context builder integration points for dynamic excerpting. Identified key functions (`format_single_employee()`, `format_employee_context()`) and content types that need excerpting (`career_summary`, `recent_highlights`). Made design decisions with user approval.

### Design Decisions Made

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Excerpting scope | Career summary + dynamic highlight limits (not all content) |
| Module location | Inline in `context.rs` (co-located with usage) |
| Sentence splitting | `unicode-segmentation` crate for accuracy |
| Budget integration | Calculate excerpt limits upfront based on employee count |

### Verification
- [x] Exploration complete
- [x] Clarifying questions answered
- [x] Plan saved to ROADMAP.md

## Session 2025-12-28 (V2.2.2 Session 1 — Token Budgets + Metrics)

**Phase:** V2.2 — Data Intelligence Pipeline
**Focus:** Build measurement infrastructure for query-adaptive retrieval

### Summary
Implemented V2.2.2c and V2.2.2d — token budget definitions and retrieval metrics. Every query now tracks: token budget allocation per query type, actual token usage (estimated), employee/memory counts, and retrieval timing. This is pure instrumentation that doesn't change retrieval behavior yet.

### Files Modified
```
src-tauri/src/context.rs  (+180 LOC) - TokenBudget, TokenUsage, RetrievalMetrics structs
                                       TokenBudget::for_query_type() static configs
                                       build_chat_context() timing + metrics tracking
                                       8 new unit tests
src/lib/types.ts          (+55 LOC)  - TypeScript interfaces for all new types
```

### Token Budgets by QueryType

| QueryType | Employee | Theme | Memory | Total |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Aggregate | 0 | 500 | 500 | 1,000 |
| Individual | 4,000 | 0 | 1,000 | 5,000 |
| List | 2,000 | 0 | 500 | 2,500 |
| Comparison | 3,000 | 0 | 500 | 3,500 |

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript type-check passes
- [x] Production build succeeds (805KB)
- [x] 195 Rust tests pass (1 pre-existing file_parser failure)
- [x] 8 new token/metrics tests pass
