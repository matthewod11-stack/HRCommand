# HR Command Center — Session Protocol

> **Purpose:** Ensure continuity across multiple Claude Code sessions.
> **Based on:** [Anthropic: Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)

---

## Core Principle

> "Each new session begins with no memory of what came before."

We use **structured artifacts** to maintain continuity:

| Artifact | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **README.md** | Project overview & status | `README.md` |
| **PROGRESS.md** | Log of completed work | `docs/PROGRESS.md` |
| **ROADMAP.md** | Checkbox tracking | `docs/ROADMAP.md` |
| **features.json** | Pass/fail status | `features.json` |
| **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** | Parking lot | `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| **DECISIONS-LOG.md** | Architectural decisions | `docs/reference/DECISIONS-LOG.md` |

## Session Start Protocol

1. **Run init script:** `./scripts/dev-init.sh`
2. **Read progress:** Review `docs/PROGRESS.md` for previous session work
3. **Check features:** Review `features.json` for pass/fail status
4. **Verify previous work:** Run `npm run build` and tests
5. **Check blockers:** Review `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
6. **Pick next task:** First unchecked item in `docs/ROADMAP.md`

### Session Start Prompt

```
I'm continuing work on HR Command Center.

This is a multi-session implementation. Please follow the session protocol:

1. Run ./scripts/dev-init.sh to verify environment
2. Read docs/PROGRESS.md for previous session work
3. Read docs/ROADMAP.md to find the NEXT unchecked task
4. Check features.json for pass/fail status
5. Check docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md for any blockers

Work on ONE task only (single-feature-per-session rule). Tell me what's next.
```

---

## Session End Protocol

1. Run verification (build, type-check, tests)
2. Add entry to TOP of `docs/PROGRESS.md`
3. Update `features.json` status
4. Check off tasks in `docs/ROADMAP.md`
5. Update `README.md` project status if phase changed or major milestone reached
6. Commit with descriptive message
7. Note "Next Session Should" in PROGRESS.md

### Session End Prompt

```
Before ending: Please follow session end protocol:

1. Run verification (build, type-check, tests)
2. Add session entry to TOP of docs/PROGRESS.md
3. Update features.json with pass/fail status
4. Check off completed task in docs/ROADMAP.md
5. Update README.md project status table if phase changed
6. Commit with descriptive message

What's the "Next Session Should" note for PROGRESS.md?
```

---

## Checkpoint Prompt (Mid-Session)

Use when context is getting long or before a complex operation:

```
Let's checkpoint. Update docs/PROGRESS.md and features.json
with current state, then we can continue.
```

---

## After Long Break Prompt

Use when resuming after days/weeks away:

```
Resuming HR Command Center after a break. Full context reload:

1. Run ./scripts/dev-init.sh
2. Read docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md (workflow rules)
3. Read docs/PROGRESS.md (all session history)
4. Read DECISIONS-LOG.md for architectural decisions
5. Check features.json and KNOWN_ISSUES.md

Summarize: where are we, what's next, any blockers?
```

## Understanding Sessions vs Tasks

**Session = Context Window** (not calendar day, not task)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Context Window                                             │
│                                                             │
│  Task A ──► Task B ──► Task C ──► [Context limit]           │
│    ↓          ↓                         ↓                   │
│  Update    Update              SESSION ENDS                 │
│   docs      docs               (update docs)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
              ┌───────────────────────────────┐
              │  NEW SESSION                  │
              │  Run init, read progress      │
              │  Continue Task C or next      │
              └───────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Update docs** → After every completed task
- **New session** → After compaction or fresh start
- **Can complete multiple tasks** in one context window
- **Large tasks can span** multiple sessions

## Commit Message Format

Use descriptive commits that serve as documentation:

```
[Phase X.Y] Brief description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2

Session: YYYY-MM-DD
```

Examples:
```
[Phase 1.1] Scaffold Tauri + React + Vite project

- Initialized project with create-tauri-app
- Added Tailwind CSS with design tokens
- Configured TypeScript strict mode

Session: 2025-12-13
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start sessions the same way** — Always run dev-init.sh
2. **Checkpoint often** — Don't wait for context limit
3. **PROGRESS.md entries at TOP** — Most recent first
4. **Descriptive commits** — They serve as documentation
5. **Park blockers immediately** — Don't let them derail progress
6. **Verify before marking complete** — Build/tests must pass
7. **Reference architecture doc** — When unsure about implementation details
